    I still remember when we were in the garden and she was telling me about how she saw the universe and what she believed in. I never really thought much about crystals and spirituality before i met her but she opened my eyes to it. Her faith is strong for christianity but her being open to understanding other faiths is one of many personalities i love about her.

    Her grandma was special to her. I never met her grandma in person but what she told me about her made me feel as if i knew her personally.
